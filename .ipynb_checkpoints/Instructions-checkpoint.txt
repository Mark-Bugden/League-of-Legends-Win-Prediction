How to setup the environment:

1. Create a Conda environment with
    conda create --name LoL python=3.7

2. Activate the environment with
    conda activate LoL

3. Install the following packages, in this order.
    conda install pip
    conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install pandas
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install requests
    pip install ratelimit
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install tqdm


Once you have the environment set up, you can run Jupyter Lab in that environment.
